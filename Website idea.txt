Theme: pastel and dark/horror

Idea 1: A lightbulb at the top (or elsewhere) on the page, which is on when the page is openend. Creating a pastel light themed website.
          However when the "dark mode" button is pressed, said lightbulb will turn "off" and activate the dark/horror theme.
          Changing all assets into a dark/horror theme version. May be included with a lightswitch sound effect.

Idea 2: A character who follows you across the webpages, possibly explaining things or just hanging out with the user.
            Character may be affected by the lightbulb mentioned in "Idea 1".
